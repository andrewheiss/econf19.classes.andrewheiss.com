<li><p>From statistical studies, we know that the supply curve for wheat in 1981 was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_S = 1800 + 240P
 \]</span></p>
<p>where price is measured in dollars per bushel and quantities are in millions of bushels per year. These studies also indicate than in 1981 the demand curve for wheat was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_D = 3550 - 266P
 \]</span></p>
<p>What was the market clearing price in 1981?</p></li>
<li><p>The demand for wheat has two components–domestic demand (demand by US consumers) and export demand (demand by foreign consumers). By the mid-1980s, the domestic demand for wheat had risen only slightly (due to modest increases in population and income), but export demand had fallen sharply. Export demand had dropped for several reasons. First and foremost, was the success of the Green Revolution in agriculture—developing countries like India that had been large importers of wheat became increasingly self-sufficient. On top of this, the increase in the value of the dollar against other currencies made US wheat more expensive abroad. Finally, European countries adopted protectionist policies that subsidized their own production and imposed tariff barriers against imported wheat. In 1985, for example, the demand curve for wheat was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_D = 2580 - 194P
 \]</span></p>
<p>The supply curve was more or less the same as 1981.</p>
<p>What was the market clearing price in 1985?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that in 1985 the Soviet Union had bought an additional 200 million bushels of US wheat. What would be the free market price of wheat have been and what quantity would have been produced and sold by US farmers?</p></li>

<p>You were just hired to be an economic analyst for a large nonprofit theater and opera house. Over the past year, the executive director of the theater has been interested in determining the market demand for theater tickets. Being of a quantitative mind, she ran a clever experiment. For one show every week, she assigned experimental prices to a pool of 250 tickets and measured how many people purchased those tickets at those prices. She collected the data in <a href="/data/ticket-demand.csv">this CSV file</a>. Your job is to use statistical and economic tools to analyze this data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a scatterplot of price and quantity, with quantity along the x-axis.</li>
<li>Use regression analysis to derive an estimated demand curve for theater tickets.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">You’ll need to break out R or SPSS or Stata, or use Excel to make a scatterplot and add the equation to the plot.<br />
<br />
</span></span> How well does the model fit the data and predict price? What could you do to get a better estimate?</li>
<li>Based on the results of the regression in #2, create a formula for ticket demand that follows this structure: <span class="math inline">\(P = aQ + b\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the coefficient, or change in quantity, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the y-intercept. Round <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to nearest hundredth (0.01).</li>
<li>Assume that the equation in #3 is the actual market demand for tickets at theaters of this size and quality.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Super big hint</em>: your formula should be <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.09Q + 57.89\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> What quantity of tickets would generate the greatest amount of revenue for your theater?<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Remember <span class="math inline">\(TR = PQ\)</span>, or TR = <span class="math inline">\(P = (-0.09Q + 57.89) Q\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.09Q^2 + 57.89Q\)</span>, and the marginal revenue is the first derivative of the total revenue, or MR = <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.18Q + 57.89\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> What is the revenue-maximizing price?</li>
<li>How many tickets would be sold if they were priced at $30 (use the assumed market demand from #3)? How elastic are tickets at $30?<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: Recall that the formula for elasticity of demand is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\)</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> when the demand formula is written in terms of Q (i.e. if the demand is written as <span class="math inline">\(Q = -0.3P + 4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\)</span> is -0.3). You can also calculate it with Excel if you divide the change in quantity by the change in price along all the different quantities and prices.<br />
<br />
</span></span> How elastic are tickets at $50? How elastic are tickets at $15? What do all these elasticities mean? Interpret them using increments of 10%.</li>
</ol>
<p>The fixed costs of running a musical performance at this theater are substantial—assume it costs $3,000 for regular upkeep of the theater, licensing and copyright arrangements, and other costs.<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">lollllz no it doesn’t. It’s way more expensive than that. But this is a fake example, so.<br />
<br />
</span></span> There are also variable costs, like the number of playbills that need to be printed, the number of ads that need to be purchased, etc. Based on past history, your executive director has estimated that the theater’s total costs of running a show can be estimated with the equation <span class="math inline">\(TC = 0.07Q^2 + 3000\)</span>. The marginal cost—or first derivative—of this total cost formula is <span class="math inline">\(MC = 0.14Q\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What quantity of tickets should the theater sell if it is interested in maximizing its profit?<span><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: Remember that profits are maximized when <span class="math inline">\(MC = MR\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> What price should it charge? How much profit would it make? Are the prices you get from the demand formula and the marginal revenue formula different? Why or why not?</li>
<li>The theater is not a monopoly and cannot set its prices willy nilly.<span><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The director was able to manipulate prices for her experiment through online sales where consumers were unaware of variations in price.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The market price for tickets to similar musicals at similar theaters is $25. Given this market price, and given the fact that the theater is a price-taker, what quantity of tickets should the theater sell to maximize its profit?<span><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: Remember that in perfect competition, price is the marginal revenue—the theater will get $25 per person regardless of how many people show up (assuming the theater is infinitely big).<br />
<br />
</span></span> How much profit will the theater make?</li>
<li>Given that it is a price-taker, what could the theater do to raise its prices and increase its profits? <strong>Discuss in ≈100 words.</strong></li>
